Sky Sports looks at the stats behind the rise of Celtic's talismanic midfielder Matt O'Riley and how the strength of his character helped him ignore the doubters and go it alone to arrive where he is today.

Thank goodness for the age of stats and data, Matt Oâ€™Riley may think from time to time, for he might have found himself on a different career path if he was playing in a not-so-bygone era.

Certainly, he is aware of some of the more traditional-thinking scouts and coaches that have previously overlooked him just because of the way he runs. But thank goodness for the age of stats and data indeed, because O'Riley has exposed their short-sightedness by smashing the data to become a title-winner with Celtic at only 22 years old.

In short, in the Scottish Premiership this season, O'Riley has the most assists (11), has created the most big chances in the division (14), has the second-most touches in the opposition box (184) and won the ball in the final third more times (28) than anyone else bar two other players - and he is a central midfielder.
