Mikel Arteta exclusive: 'The moment I leave this door at Arsenal one day, I'll look back and say we had good times'
In an exclusive Sky Sports interview, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta reflects on the giddiness of Arsenal's exciting season and the gutting nature of how their title quest unravelled; watch Nottingham Forest vs Arsenal live on Sky Sports from 5pm on Saturday Night Football, kick-off 5.30pm
The vista varies depending on who is framing Arsenal's season. Would it be failure to have been perched on the Premier League summit for 248 days only to cede the title to Manchester City?

Or is it a triumph of process that a team who widely weren't tipped for the top four forced Pep Guardiola's machine into an unseen gear, marmalising all before them?
"I think everybody would describe the situation with different words," Arsenal's manager tells Sky Sports News from the club's London Colney base.

"But probably the same people who thought that we were going to finish sixth or seventh in the season are now saying that finishing second would be a failure. You have all the answers in that."
